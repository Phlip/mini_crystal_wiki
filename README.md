# mini_crystal_wiki

The tiniest possible private C2-style wiki

WARNING: Don't use on an untrusted network. Bots will attack, and we use no login!

Getting started:

Crystagiri is our only dependency; for tests. Install it with `shards`.

Launch with `crystal mini_server.cr`.

Hit http://localhost:8080/

And bow before the wiki!
